# E-textiles-resources

E-textiles or electronic textiles are, as the name suggests, any kind of textiles (clothes, accessories, home items etc) that have embedded electronics in them.

E-textiles hobby scene is not as organized as for example knitting and sewing scene, and so we, a group of e-textile hobbyists decided to start documenting our resources (shops, online learning materials, places for inspiration and tutorials) here on GitHub.
